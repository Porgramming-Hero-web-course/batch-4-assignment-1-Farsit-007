 ## The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

 ## Understanding Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript 
   
   TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, is known for its robust type system, which helps developers write cleaner, more maintainable, and less error-prone code. Among the powerful tools in TypeScript's arsenal are union and intersection types.

 ### Union Types: 
   Imagine a variable that can hold either a string or a number. This is where union types come in handy. They allow you to define a type that can be one of several types.

  ```js 
     type StringOrNumber = string | number;
     let value: StringOrNumber;
     value = "hello"; 
     value = 42; 
  ```
  In this example, value can be assigned either a string or a number.

  ### Intersection Types:

Intersection types, on the other hand, allow you to combine multiple types into a single type.
    
  ```js 
     interface Person {
         name: string;
         age: number;
     }
     interface Address {
         street: string;
         city: string;
     }
    type PersonAndAddress = Person & Address;
    let personAndAddress: PersonAndAddress = {
         name: "Alice",
         age: 30,
         city: "CTG"
    }; 
  ```
  Here, PersonAndAddress inherits properties from both Person and Address. This is particularly useful when you need to create complex types that combine multiple traits or characteristics.
